               +-------------------------------+
               |  AWS Organization (Root)      |
               |-------------------------------|

## 📦 **Primary vs Secondary Backup**

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🟦 **Primary Backup** | Stored in each account/region's own vault. Useful for fast restore. |
| 🟩 **Secondary Backup** | Copy of backup data stored in a **centralized account/region** for **disaster recovery**, **compliance**, or **cross-region failover**. |

This is a **best practice** in backup systems: always maintain **off-site** or **off-region** backups.

---

## 🌍 **Multi-account / Multi-region Explained**

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔹 **Multi-account** | Different AWS accounts for prod/dev/test teams or business units. Improves **security isolation**. |
| 🔸 **Multi-region** | Resources (like EC2, RDS, etc.) are deployed in different AWS regions. Helps with **disaster recovery** and **compliance**. |
| 🛡️ **AWS Organizations** | Master account + all member accounts. Allows **centralized billing**, **SCPs**, and **cross-account permissions**. |

The solution uses **AWS Organizations** to:
- Ensure only trusted accounts can access/copy backups
- Simplify deployment and IAM trust setup between accounts

---

## 🔐 **IAM Roles vs SCPs**

| IAM Role | SCP |
|----------|-----|
| Allow **services** (e.g., AWS Backup, Lambda) to act on resources | Prevent users/accounts from doing unauthorized actions |
| Scoped to a single account (can include trust to others) | Applied **at the organization or OU level** |
| Example: “Allow Backup to use KMS Key” | Example: “Deny copying backup vault to accounts outside the org” |

So:
- IAM = **who can do what** inside an account
- SCP = **what’s allowed in principle** across the org

---

## ✅ **What This Helps You Achieve**

1. **Disaster Recovery Readiness**
   - Backup copies in another account & region.
   - Automated restore validation (with Lambda).
2. **Compliance & Governance**
   - SCPs enforce org-wide rules.
   - KMS for encryption.
   - Centralized logging/reporting.
3. **Infrastructure as Code & CI/CD**
   - CloudFormation templates to replicate this setup easily.
   - CodePipeline & CodeBuild for testing before deployment.
4. **Scalability**
   - Easily extend to more accounts or regions.
   - Framework supports adding new workloads/resources.

## Prepare

### Enable required AWS Organizations features and Delegated Administrator permissions

The Backup and Recovery with AWS Backup solution uses a service-managed StackSet to configure AWS Backup in accounts within the AWS Organization Units (OUs) you specify.  The solution utilizes service-managed CloudFormation StackSets to consistently deploy and manage required AWS Backup resources such as vaults, encryption keys, and IAM roles.  New accounts added to the target OUs will automatically be configured with the Backup and Recovery with AWS Backup solution.

You will need to enable trusted access between AWS CloudFormation StackSets and AWS Organizations.  You can [follow the directions in the CloudFormation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.html).

You will also need to enable trusted access for AWS Backup and turn on policy and monitoring access.  You can follow the [AWS Backup directions to enable trusted access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-backup.html#integrate-enable-ta-backup).

* In your AWS Organizations Management account, confirm that setup was successful:

      aws organizations list-aws-service-access-for-organization

You should see the following:
```json
        {
            "ServicePrincipal": "member.org.stacksets.cloudformation.amazonaws.com",
            "DateEnabled": "XXXX-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX.XXXXXX+XX:XX"
        },
        {
            "ServicePrincipal": "backup.amazonaws.com",
            "DateEnabled": "XXXX-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX.XXXXXX+XX:XX"
        }
```

### Register Delegated Administrator account 

#### **CloudFormation Service-Managed StackSets**
Your AWS Organizations management account is the only account by default that has rights to deploy service-managed CloudFormation stacksets.  However, you can register other accounts as delegated administrators for AWS Organizations features such as service-managed stack set deployments.  A specific account for tihs solution si defined as the **solution home account** and the selected region for the solution is called the **solution home region** where you will deploy the majority of the solution components.  This account must be registered as a delegated administrator because it will deploy and update the service-managed stacksets used in the solution.

Take the following steps to enable delegated administrator permissions for your organization:

* Register the solution home account as a delegated administrator: 

      aws organizations register-delegated-administrator --account-id=<Solution Home AWS Account Number> --service-principal=member.org.stacksets.cloudformation.amazonaws.com 

* Verify that the registration succeeded:

      aws organizations list-delegated-administrators

* Verify that the delegated service is enabled:

      aws organizations list-delegated-services-for-account --account-id <Solution Home AWS Account Number>

#### **AWS Backup Policy Management & Monitoring**

The solution manages backup policies and cross-account reporting for your AWS organization via CloudFormation.  In order for the solution to manage policies and establish organization-level monitoring and reporting you will need to register the solution account as a delegated administrator for AWS Backup.

Take the following steps to enable delegated administrator permissions for your organization:

* Register the solution home account as a delegated administrator:

      aws organizations register-delegated-administrator --account-id=<Solution Home AWS Account Number> --service-principal=backup.amazonaws.com 

* Verify that the registration succeeded:

      aws organizations list-delegated-administrators

* Verify that the delegated service is enabled:

      aws organizations list-delegated-services-for-account --account-id <Solution Home AWS Account Number>

### Grant the Solution Home Account Delegated Administrator permissions to manage AWS Organizations Backup Policies
Before you can manage and update AWS Organizations backup policies from another AWS account, you need to grant that account permissions via a [resource-based delegation policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_delegate_policies.html) in your AWS Organizations management account.

The [aws-backup-org-resource-policy-delegate-backup-policy-mgmt.yaml](./cloudformation/stacks/aws-backup-org-resource-policy-delegate-backup-policy-mgmt.yaml) CloudFormation template has been provided to deploy a resource-based delegation policy that grants the AWS account you have chosen for the solution to manage AWS Backup policies for the AWS organization.

Deploy this template in your AWS Organizations Management account using the AWS console or run this command using the AWS CLI.  

Make sure your permissions are set to your AWS Organizations management account before using this CLI command:

      aws cloudformation create-stack \
          --stack-name "aws-backup-org-resource-policy-delegate-backup-policy-mgmt"  \
          --template-body "file://cloudformation/stacks/aws-backup-org-resource-policy-delegate-backup-policy-mgmt.yaml" \
          --parameters ParameterKey=SolutionHomeAccountId,ParameterValue=<The AWS Account Id where you are deploying the solution> \
                       ParameterKey=pOrganizationRootId,ParameterValue=<The AWS Organization Root ID> \
                       ParameterKey=pOrganizationId,ParameterValue=<The AWS Organization ID> \
          --tags "Key"="Application","Value"="Backup and Recovery with AWS Backup Solution" \
          --region <run this command in one region of your choice>

# Deployment
The solution utilizes AWS CodePipeline for orchestration and deployment of AWS resources to your selected AWS organizational unit (OU) accounts.  

The default source code configuration in CodePipeline utilizes GitHub.  If you wish to use another source code provider then you can update the CodePipeline **SourceStage** in [_backup-recovery-with-aws-backup.yaml](_backup-recovery-with-aws-backup.yaml) CloudFormation template appropriately.

## GitHub Setup

### 1. Fork this GitHub repository
Fork the GitHub repository so that you can make necessary changes while still keeping track of new enhancements and updates to the solution.

Follow the instructions below, confirming that each created CloudFormation stack is in the **CREATE_COMPLETE** state 
before proceeding with the next step.

### 2. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub
Before deploying the CloudFormation template, you'll need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub:

* Go to your GitHub account settings.
* Navigate to Developer Settings > Tokens (classic).
* Click Generate New Token and give it a descriptive name.
* Select the following scopes:
  * repo (Full control of private repositories)
  * admin:repo_hook (Full control of repository hooks)
* Generate the token and copy it.

You will use this token as a secret in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to allow CodePipeline to access your GitHub repository.

### 3. Deploy the Primary Quick Start CloudFormation stack in your Selected Solution Home Account and Region
Login to the AWS console for your selected solution home account & region and deploy the [_backup-recovery-with-aws-backup.yaml](_backup-recovery-with-aws-backup.yaml) CloudFormation template.

### 4. Update the [aws-backup-org-policy.yaml](./cloudformation/stacks/aws-backup-org-policy.yaml) CloudFormation template

The [aws-backup-org-policy.yaml](./cloudformation/stacks/aws-backup-org-policy.yaml) CloudFormation template is used to manage your AWS Organizations Backup policies.  The template uses the [AWS::Organizations::Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-organizations-policy.html) to manage Backup policies for the AWS Organization as a delegated administrator via CloudFormation.

Ensure that you have given your solution home account delegated administrator permissions as described in the first step of this deployment section.

The provided template uses the [Fn::ToJsonString](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-ToJsonString.html) CloudFormation transformation, allowing you to manage your [Backup Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_backup_syntax.html#backup-policy-syntax-reference) in YAML syntax within CloudFormation.

This example implements the following policy properties:

* For all supported resources in the target regions and target OUs that are tagged with the tag key **backup** and the tag value **daily**, perform a nightly backup at 05:00 UTC.  The backup will have a retention period of 35 days.  The backups will also be copied to the selected central backup vault.  If the backup doesn't complete in 1200 (20 hours) then it will be cancelled.
* For all supported resources in the target regions and target OUs that are tagged with the tag key **backup** and the tag value **monthly**, perform a monthly backup at 05:00 UTC on the first day of each month.  The backup will have a retention period of 366 days.  The backups will also be copied to the selected central backup vault.  If the backup doesn't complete in 1200 (20 hours) then it will be cancelled.

#### **REQUIRED**
At a minimum, update the **copy_actions** key with your central backup vault ARN in the [aws-backup-org-policy stack](./cloudformation/stacks/aws-backup-org-policy.yaml) CloudFormation template.  The key value has a placeholder called **<Replace with value from pCentralBackupVaultArn>**.  You must do this for each resource defined in the template.

You can retrieve the AWS Backup central vault ARN by logging into the **AWS Backup Central Account ID** and **AWS Backup Central Account Region** you specified when you deployed the solution.  Proceed to the **Vaults** section in AWS Backup console. 

### 5.  Enable the Stage Transition for DeployBackupOrgPolicy
By default, the DeployBackupOrgPolicy stage transition is disabled to allow you to update the [aws-backup-org-policy.yaml](./cloudformation/stacks/aws-backup-org-policy.yaml) CloudFormation template backup policy.  

Enable the stage transition in the AWS CodePipeline console after you have updated the policies and **copy_actions** keys with your central backup vault ARN.

## AWS Backup Service Control Policies
You can further refine security for your AWS Backup deployment by implementing organization-wide Service Control Policies for the **backup:CopyFromBackupVault** permission.

### Limit Copy From AWS Backup Vault To Central Vault
You can deploy the [limit-copy-from-vault-to-central-vault.yaml](cloudformation%2Fstacks%2Fscp%2Flimit-copy-from-vault-to-central-vault.yaml) CloudFormation template to limit AWS Backup Vault backup copies to be shared only with the solution's designated AWS Backup Central Vault.

This service control policies ensures that AWS organizations accounts do not share their backup copies with any other AWS Backup Vault other than the secondary copy in the central AWS Backup Vault account and region you have specified.

### Limit Copy From AWS Backup Vault to AWS Organization
You can deploy the [limit-copy-from-vault-to-org.yaml](cloudformation%2Fstacks%2Fscp%2Flimit-copy-from-vault-to-org.yaml) CloudFormation template to limit AWS Backup Vault copies to within the AWS Organization.  

This is less restrictive than the [limit-copy-from-vault-to-central-vault.yaml](cloudformation%2Fstacks%2Fscp%2Flimit-copy-from-vault-to-central-vault.yaml) CloudFormation template because it allows accounts within your AWS Backup account to potentially share their AWS Backup vault with other accounts within your AWS organization.
